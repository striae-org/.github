## NPM Package Content Policy

This package intentionally includes only non-sensitive defaults and runtime source needed for setup.

Included:

- `app/` source (with `app/config-example/`)
- `functions/`, `public/`
- Worker package manifests
- Worker source files needed by the example workers, including nested helper modules, while excluding production worker entry files (`workers/*/src/**/*.ts` excluding `workers/*/src/**/*worker.ts`)
- PDF worker example support files limited to `workers/pdf-worker/src/assets/generated-assets.example.ts` and `workers/pdf-worker/src/formats/format-striae.ts` (no extra PDF image assets or custom formats)
- Worker example Wrangler configs (`workers/*/wrangler.jsonc.example`)
- Project-level example and build config (`.env.example`, `wrangler.toml.example`, `tsconfig.json`, etc.)

Excluded (by design):

- Real runtime config under `app/config/`
- Real worker config files (for example `workers/*/wrangler.jsonc`)
- Local secrets and machine-specific files
- Extra repository metadata not required for npm consumers

## Security Notes

- Do not commit secrets to `app/config/`, `.env`, or worker config files.
- Use only example files as templates and provide real values in your own private environment.
- Review release notes for security updates before deployment.
